Empty looks, empty faces on the pavement
Tangerine shadows follow every place
No looks, just phones and a basement
Broken bottles in the club, that's arrangement
Change the station, change location
Change the weather every time I go to save her
Playground, big grounds, no skylight
But I'm running in the loins with my light out
And the sun's out, there's no fun now
There's a shadow of a city on my gun now
Had a shotgun, in a taxi
If it's good then it's better than it must be
I'm okay now, feeling great now
Living in a big bubble but I stay down
Take the train out every station
There's no stations anymore in the nation
We can walk, we can talk, do together
If I want it, I want it forever
Took your place, took the chase, took it all away
Took my heart, took my phone and my cash away
I don't care, yeah I spray, spray it all over
But it's good 'cause we live in a fall over
Following time, there's no time when it's ice out
Ice out, feel like I am Bruce Willis' prime time
I walk around and I shine with no rhinestones
There's no life in my eyes, there's just eye stones
When I remember my grandma in a night gown
In a night gown, a warrior
I'm a street tangerine living warrior
Take the night train, but it's no train
It never ends, since I was 14 I always felt insane
But I saved her, see you later
I think she saved me, I think she kept me from going crazy
But it's never night, it's no goth time
I'm no Batman but I'm out here robbin'
