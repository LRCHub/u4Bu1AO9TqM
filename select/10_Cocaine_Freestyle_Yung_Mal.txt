Stuck with a Glock
I got a thot
Ima get a spot, inner lane, middle finger to the cops
I could never drop no names (nah)
They say my flow like crack, cocaine
Sunday I might ride in range
Money started change things (damn)
Choppas just like Harly
Bitch retarded I had da potty training (yeah)
Mom seeing all that money she almost faint
I walked in the club, bitch thought it was raining
I fucked her didn't even know her name
Can't break the code I break the bank
Niggas talk like hold your ship might sink (pussy)
You know niggas super lame
Super charge, switching lanes, still with the gang
All that came
Marry the money I bought a ring
Bans busting out these jeans,
That 40 it made them dance, he busting moves like Billie Jean
2 cups filled with lean
Push up on the scene (yeah)
Niggas quiet when they see me (shhh)
Trap it out, renew the lease
Got it hot just like glis (hot)
Keep that Glock right by me
I got rich off killin' beats
I'm to real don't do the beef, but if you play with me they sweet
Don't play, spray yo block all week
Bullets knock down houses, trees
Plate is dying, get out the skreet (damn)
This money got me blind,
Dollar signs all I see the cars I drive don't need a key
Got rich as fuck I feel like Pyrex on your head R.I.P pussy
Pull up got them hoes looking (pull up)
Drive that vet just like I vet
Got yall niggas riding inside your wishes
Kill him, his family won't just hide
We don't bullshit (told you)
All these tears got tape on the clip
Rock the show, bought glossy scrap? (yeah)
Came a long way from that killer crib
Can't get no sleep I'm booked
He went broke, he ran out of luck (ha)
Showing love might get you cut
My stash spot I filled it up
Check the score we up this trap the trailer full, where we go we up
All this ice, hockey puck, bitch I get Milwaukee Bucks
