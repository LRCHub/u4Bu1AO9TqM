(Wake up, F1lthy)

Yeah, I put that ho in Prada, and after, I made her holler
And my bro took off your mans, I heard that was your top shotter
I got Vetements on my pants and my shirt Balenciaga
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

My swag came a long way, I was rockin' nada
I don't give a fuck 'bout what a ho say, these hoes not my problem
Sent 100 shots out that Rolls, ayy, them 7.62s got him
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

Them 7.62s hit his body, made him Harlem Shake
I get to that bag, to that cake, you procrastinate
Now she wanna fuck with me now, but she pulled up too late
When I send my boy a opp to drop, he be so fascinated

Fuck the D.A., they ain't got no evidence, they closed they case
If a nigga thinkin' this shit sweet, he get shot in his face
I got Glock 19s, ARPs, I got hella K's
I been serving codeine to these fiends, yeah, they sippin' drank

5K a pt, what you mean? Bitch, that's no debate
I been countin' blues, countin' green like it's Earth Day
And the nigga think he me, but he not me on my worst day
I just spent your rent on my motherfuckin' shirt

These niggas think we playin', hell nah, this ain't Nerf
Pull up to a nigga land, pull up to his turf
Pull up with that MAC-10, pull up, go berserk
I been off that X again, I feel it in my nerves

Now she wanna fuck with Ken, that lil' bitch get curved
My lil' bitch, she not a ten, she a 130
And I withdraw all the money that was at the bank, bitch, that's word
I got Wockhardt in my system, that's why my words slurred

They was so surprised when they killed him, but that boy was chirpin' like a bird
Nigga, I'm the shit like a turd, but my shit smell like cologne
I fuck her face, yeah, I fuck her makeup up, then I send that bitch home

You don't wanna race, yeah, this an SRT with a Redeye package on it
You don't want no smoke, bitch, FN Five-seveN shoot a nigga in his dome
Hit that boy in his chest, hit his heart, now it's chrome
Huh, I told that pussy nigga, "Yeah, leave me alone", huh, huh

Shouldn't have fucked with a member, huh
You shouldn't have fucked with the gang, huh
You shouldn't have fucked with the X-M-A-N, yeah, X-Man
And all my niggas masked up, yeah, yeah, yeah, just like Bane
And all my niggas in control of this shit, yeah, like a game
